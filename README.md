# 100 Days of Swift 

Welcome to my 100 Days of Swift Challenge repository! As part of Paul Hudson's [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) challenge, I'm using this project to help me learn Swift and iOS development.

## Structure of the Repository

This repository is organized by days. Each folder represents a day of the challenge, containing the projects and exercises completed on that day.
